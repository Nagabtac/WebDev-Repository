        <p>Diego Marcilla and Isabel de Segura were deeply in love, 
            but her wealthy father refused their marriage until Diego could return with fortune in five years. 
            Diego came back too late, finding Isabel married to another, and when she refused to kiss him out of loyalty, 
            he died of heartbreak. Overcome with grief, Isabel finally kissed his lifeless lips and immediately died beside him. 
            Moved by their tragic love, the townspeople buried them together, 
            and their story remains a symbol of eternal devotion in Teruel, Spain.</p>
